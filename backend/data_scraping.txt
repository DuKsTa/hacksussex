Question:
"
What's accidental damage cover?
"

Answer:
"
Accidental damage covers you for damage caused by one off accidents to either your property or its contents. 

If your policy number starts with 'H', you're automatically covered for damage to:

Contents - Home entertainment equipment, mirrors and glass.

You can upgrade to our additional level which also covers you for things like spillages on your carpet or sofa.

Buildings - Fixed glass, sanitary ware, pipes and cables.

You can upgrade to our additional level which also covers you for things like putting your foot through a ceiling or leaving a tap running.  

You can see if you’re covered in your documents under ‘Statement of insurance’. 

If your policy number starts with 'XA', you don't have accidental damage cover included as standard, but can add it to your policy any time to cover you for all of the above.
You can see if you’re covered in your documents under ‘Policy summary’.

If my address changes, do I need to inform you straight away?

Question:
"
What happens if the accident is my fault?
"
Answer:
"
If you have a comprehensive policy and you're involved in an accident, we'll make it our priority to get you back on the road as quickly as possible. We'll either arrange for your vehicle to be repaired or make a payment for your vehicle if it's a total loss (or 'write off'). If the accident involved someone else, we'll contact them and offer to repair their vehicle or pay for a replacement if it's a total loss. This allows us to settle the claim as quickly as possible and control the costs involved too. If there's any disagreement about who was at fault, we'll review all the evidence available. We can then determine who was responsible - and if we can recover all or some of our costs. We'll let you know the outcome and if your policy has been impacted. 

If you have a third-party fire and theft policy or third party only, your policy doesn't include cover for accidental damage to your own vehicle, so you can't make a claim for the costs of fixing or replacing it. If there are any claims made against you, we will deal with them.

Do I need car insurance?
If you own or drive a car, you’re legally required to have car insurance in the UK. Unless you officially register your car as off the road with a SORN, or if you’re in the process of buying or selling it, you could face a fine for not having insurance. 
 

What are the different types of car insurance?
Third party 
Third party fire and theft 
Comprehensive car insurance.  
To make car insurance comparison easier, here's a quick rundown of what each level includes: 

Third party
This is the minimum level of insurance required by law. If you're involved in an accident, it covers damage to the other person's property, but costs to repair or replace your car will come from your pocket. And you won't be covered if your car is stolen or damaged by fire. 

Third party fire and theft
Third party fire and theft cover offers the same cover as a third-party policy but you're also covered if your car's stolen or damaged/destroyed by fire. 

Comprehensive
This provides you with the highest level of cover. If you're involved in an accident, the policy will pay out for costs associated with you and the third party. It also offers protection against fire and theft. 

People assume that third-party policies are the cheapest but, because more people claim on this type of insurance, they can cost just as much as – or sometimes more than – comprehensive policies. Even if comprehensive cover is a little more expensive, you benefit from a far greater level of protection on the road. 

There are also specialist insurance policies to suit different drivers, like: 

Multi Car cover 

YouDrive telematics insurance 

Business car policies 

What features can I get with my car insurance?
We offer lots of policy features as standard, plus a range of optional extras to suit your needs. These include: 

Courtesy car cover, providing a replacement vehicle if yours needs to be repaired. 
Windscreen cover, paying for repair or replacement costs for a cracked windscreen. 
Vandalism promise, which covers costs if your car is intentionally damaged. 
Uninsured driver promise, which safeguards you if you’re involved in a non-fault accident with an uninsured driver. 
Personal belongings cover, to cover costs if valuable items inside your car get stolen or damaged. 
Four levels of optional breakdown cover, from basic roadside assistance to cover at home and in Europe. 
Car key protection in case you damage, lose or have your car keys stolen. 
Legal protection to cover legal costs if you want to take action against another driver or defend yourself against accusations. 
Enhanced personal accident cover to offer financial compensation for you and up to six passengers if you suffer injuries. 
Compare our car insurance policies and the features that they include to find the right level of cover for you.

How much does car insurance cost?
There's no set price for car insurance. This is because car insurance companies calculate premiums based on a range of factors unique to you. These include: 

Age and years of driving experience – younger, less experienced drivers usually cost more to insure as they’re seen as higher-risk. 
Your driving history (claims and points, etc.). 
Postcode, with cars kept in high-crime areas usually costlier to insure. 
Where you keep your car during the day and night, for example in a garage or on the street. 
Occupation – some jobs are seen as riskier if they involve lots of driving, for example. 
Annual mileage – the longer that you spend on the road, the higher the risk of accidents. 
The car you drive also plays a big part in the price of cover, with car insurance companies taking into account: 

Value 
Modifications 
Performance 
Safety features 
How to get cheaper car insurance quotes
As well as comparing car insurance quotes for our different policies, there are many things that you can do to make sure that you pay the lowest possible price.  

Build a no claims discount by driving carefully and avoiding making claims for one year or more (though we still offer competitive car insurance for new drivers). 

Consider telematics insurance, which tracks and rewards sensible driving through a device fitted to your car. 

Improve your car’s security by storing it somewhere safe overnight and fitting approved extras like an alarm or immobiliser. 

Pay for insurance annually rather than monthly if you can afford to, as monthly payments include interest. 

Increase your voluntary excess (as long as you can still afford to pay it if you need to). 

You can find more handy tips on our budget car insurance page. 

How to check if a car is insured?
The easiest way to check your car's insured is in the Motor Insurer's Database. The website contains information on all insured vehicles in the UK – all you need is your car’s registration number to use it.

How to get car insurance
When taking out cover, you'll need to enter details about you and your car. Here are some details that we’ll ask you to give so that we can provide a tailored insurance quote for your car: 

Car registration number 
Driving licence number 
Address and work address if you'll use the car for work 
Years of no-claims discount 
Estimated value of your car 
Details of claims and convictions/motoring offences (if applicable) 
Estimated annual mileage 
Bank details (for payment). 
What details do you need to insure a car?
When taking out car insurance, you'll need to enter details about you and your car. Here are some details you'll be asked to give:

Car registration number
Driving licence number
Address and work address if you'll use the car for work
Years of no-claims discount
Estimated value of your car
Details of claims and convictions/motoring offences (if applicable)
Estimated annual mileage
Bank details (for payment)
How long is a car insurance quote valid for?
We’ll keep your car insurance quote safe on our system for 30 days. Bear in mind that the price could go up or down in the meantime. This usually happens if new risk information comes out – for example, new safety ratings for your car.

Can you get an insurance quote without a car?
As getting car insurance quotes require specific information about the car, it's not possible to get a quote without a car. That’s unless you know the car you're buying and its registration number. 

If you're on the hunt for budget car insurance and haven't yet bought your car, we recommend spending some time looking around for cheap cars to insure. All cars are grouped into one of 50 different insurance classes, with the cheapest cars in group 1. So, if you want to save on cover, your best bet is to choose a car in a lower group. See your chosen car’s insurance group by using Thatcham Research’s My Vehicle Search tool. 

Can I transfer my car insurance policy to a new car?
Yes, simply log in to our app or MyAccount and: 

Select 'manage policy', then 'manage vehicle' and add your new car details. 

You'll be given a car insurance quote, including any change to the total price and any additional fees. If you're happy, simply click ‘continue’. If your total price decreases, you'll be a due a refund or, if your price has increased, you can select how you'd like to pay. 

We'll let you know when your new policy documents are ready. This can normally take up to two hours and you'll still be insured on your old car on the day when your new policy starts.  

How can I make a car insurance claim?
If something’s happened to your car, it’s quick and easy to start a new claim online. Just log into our app or MyAccount to get started, and we’ll do what we can to help you get back on the road. Find more information on our car claims page.

How does no claims discount work on a multi car policy?
On a Multi Car insurance policy, as long as each car has a separate policyholder, each policyholder will be able to build up their no-claims discount as they would on a single-car policy. 

If one of the cars on the account is involved in an accident, then the discount on that vehicle will be reduced unless the policyholder has no claims discount protection. 
 

Is it cheaper to add a second driver?
Adding a second or named driver to your Multi Car insurance policy could mean cheaper premiums. However, this depends on the profile of the people you're adding. 

The profile is based on the other driver's driving record and history. For instance, if they're inexperienced or have points on their licence, it could end up increasing the cost of your cover. 

Is Multi Car insurance worth it?
If you have multiple vehicles or want to group together the insurance of the people you live with, then Multi Car insurance could be worth it to enjoy a discount on cover. 

Make sure to check the price of individual policies versus our Multi Car discount on each car to work out whether it’s right for you. To find out how much your cover could cost, get a quote today.

Can I get Multi Car insurance if I already have a policy with Hastings Direct?
Yes, you can get a Multi Car policy if you’re already covered by Hastings Direct. Upgrade to a Multi Car policy in MyAccount or our app. Or just give us a call on 0333 005 1156.

How many cars can I add to a Multi Car policy
You can add up to four extra cars to your Multi Car policy, up to a total of five cars. 

Can you have two main drivers on the same car?
No, you can’t – any car insurance policy needs to have one main driver (policyholder) and then any additional drivers are added as named drivers. 

Can cars be removed from Multi Car insurance?
Yes, they can. If you want to remove a car from your Multi Car insurance policy, then please get in touch.

How long does my Multi Car policy last?
Our Multi Car insurance typically lasts 12 months before renewal. If you add any additional vehicles during the 12-month term, they will be renewed at the same time as the first. 

Can I drive all the cars on my Multi Car policy?
For each car you’ll need to be the policy holder or named driver.

Home Insurance
What is home insurance?
Home insurance protects your home and belongings against loss or damage caused by things like fire and theft.

With the right home insurance policy, your provider will cover the costs to repair or replace the building or its contents should something unexpected happen.

If you're just about to take your first step onto the property ladder or simply need a refresh, here's all you need to know about home insurance.

What does home insurance cover?
There are three main home insurance types:

buildings only insurance,
contents only insurance, or
combined buildings and contents cover.
Here's a summary of what they cover:

Cover Included			
Alternative accommodation cover for all your family and pets    	
New for old (excluding linens and clothing)	
Buildings insurance	£500,000	£1,000,000	£1,000,000
Up to £150,000 contents cover	
24 hour claims helpline	
Home legal expenses up to £100,000 cover	Optional	Optional	
Home emergency cover	Optional	Optional	
 

The services we provide are covered under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Buildings only insurance
Covers the cost to repair or replace the actual bricks and mortar of your home if it's damaged or destroyed by things like fire, water leaks or storms. Outbuildings such as sheds and garages are also covered, as are permanent fixtures like fitted kitchens and bathroom suites.

Contents only insurance
Protects your personal belongings against loss or damage caused by things like theft, attempted theft, fire, smoke, water leaks and weather-related damage. Items covered include everything from your sofa and TV to your bed and clothes. You can take out extra cover for high-value items and items you take away from the home, like bicycles.

Combined buildings and contents
Combines the above types of cover into one, easier-to-manage policy. Taking out combined insurance means you only have one renewal date to remember and you're likely to get a discount on your premium too.

Is it a legal requirement to have home insurance?
Buildings insurance isn't required by law if you're living in, or renting out, a property you own.

If this is your first home, you'll need buildings cover when you take out a mortgage. Your mortgage provider or broker's likely to suggest a certain home insurance provider, but this might not get you the best deal. So get a few home insurance quotes before making a decision.

While it's not a legal requirement to have contents insurance, if you didn't have cover you'd be putting your belongings at risk. If your sofa was ruined by floodwater or your jewellery was stolen, the costs to repair or replace them would come from your own pocket.

If a number of your belongings were damaged, destroyed or stolen at the same time, it could work out extremely expensive – certainly more than the annual premium for contents cover. So this type of insurance is seriously worth considering.

What home insurance do I need if I rent?
If you're a tenant, your landlord is responsible for taking out buildings insurance. It's still important to check they've got this covered when you sign the tenancy agreement – don't be afraid to ask for proof.

Contents insurance for your personal possessions is down to you though. Cover for the landlord's contents, like the sofa if they rent the property part-furnished, is their responsibility.

Does home insurance cover boilers?
Most home insurance policies don't cover boilers as standard, so you'll need to take out extra cover.

Home emergency cover with Hastings Direct offers protection for a range of unexpected household emergencies, including boiler breakdowns. If your boiler stops working, all you need to do is ring the helpline on your policy documents, and we'll send an approved tradesperson to fix it.
This type of policy also covers things like faulty heating systems, draining and plumbing issues, roof damage and failure of power and gas supplies.

What is motorbike insurance?

What are the types of motorbike insurance?
There are three main types of insurance for a motorbike: third party, third party fire and theft, and comprehensive.

Third party is the most basic level of insurance and covers the third party and their property in the event of an accident. Your bike won't be covered if it's stolen or damaged.
Third party fire and theft offers the same level of cover as third party, plus your bike is protected if it's stolen or damaged/destroyed by fire.
Comprehensive insurance provides the best level of protection, packing all the benefits of third party insurance and covering you and your bike if you're injured in an accident or your bike is damaged/destroyed or stolen. It'll pay out for accidents even if you're found to be at fault.
Comprehensive motorbike cover might cost more, but you're paying for added protection – which for many bikers is worth it.

Do you need insurance on a bike?
Yes – if you ride a bike on public roads, you need to have it insured. Third party insurance is the minimum level of cover required by law.

How much is motorbike insurance?
It's impossible to say how much bike insurance will cost you, as it depends on a wide range of factors. These include everything from your age and riding record, to what you use your bike for and where you live.

The type of bike you ride is a big factor, too. The more powerful your machine, the higher the risk of accidents – and insurers balance out this risk by charging higher premiums. So, you might find insurance for a moped is far cheaper than for super-quick sport bike.

Classic bikes usually cost more to insure than newer models too, especially if they're rare, because parts will be more expensive to get hold of.

How can I get cheaper bike insurance?
You can't change all factors that affect the price you pay for insurance on a motorbike, but there are some ways you can cut the cost of cover. These include:

Boost your bike's security. Fitting an immobiliser on your bike or storing it in your garage overnight could lead to cheaper insurance.
Pay for cover annually. You'll usually pay interest if you pay your premium in monthly instalments, so you could save cash paying for it in one lump sum.
Improve your riding skills. Gaining an advanced qualification could lead to cheaper cover so long as it's recognised by your insurance provider. These include things like a BikeSafe certificate, Enhanced Rider Scheme and RoSPA Advanced Motorcycle Training.
Buy a less powerful bike. Just about to buy your first set of wheels? Opting for a less powerful bike will lower your premium – not to mention, it's safer to start off on a slower bike.
Increase your excess. Raising your excess usually results in cheaper cover, but you need to be sure you can afford to pay it if you were to claim on your policy.
Can you insure two bikes on one policy?
Do you own more than one bike? Perhaps you ride one bike to work and save the other for Sunday cruises. If so, you could save money by covering both machines under a single multi bike policy.

Unlike a multi car policy, it only covers you, the main rider – and only allows for one bike to be on the road at any given time. That's why the cost of cover is usually cheaper, and it'll be easier for you to manage too.

All motorbikes are grouped in terms of their power and value, with most bikes falling under groups 3-17. If you've got a bike in a lower group, then under a multi bike policy, it could balance out the cost of cover for a higher group bike.

How do I claim on bike insurance?
If you've been involved in an accident or had your bike stolen and need to make a claim, you should find all the details you need in your insurance documents sent over to you by your provider when you took out cover.

Motorbike insurance with Hastings Direct
Hastings Direct offers two levels of bike insurance so you can make sure you get the right cover for your needs.

Van insurance
If you rely on your van for work, an accident, theft or breakdown could cause everything to grind to a halt. Quality van insurance will help get your business back up and running as quickly as possible, giving you peace of mind your livelihood is well protected.

What is van insurance?
Just like car and bike cover, there are three levels of van insurance: third party (the most basic policy), third party fire and theft, and comprehensive. Comprehensive insurance is the highest level of cover, protecting you, your belongs and any third parties against accidents, damage, fire and theft.

 

Van insurance comes in different types, and the right policy for you will depend on your personal circumstances. It's a little more confusing than car insurance, so to help make things clear, we've put together this simple guide on insurance for vans.

What is commercial van insurance?
Most people looking to insure a van will need a commercial van policy. In fact, the only time you wouldn't need commercial cover is if you use the van solely for domestic and social activities - like doing the shopping or transporting bikes. In this case, you'll need social, domestic and pleasure cover under a private van insurance policy.

 

Basically, if your van is used for work in any way, and if you travel to and from more than one location on a daily basis, you'll need to take out a commercial policy - also called business van insurance.

 

There's a grey area when it comes to use of the van for car boot sales. If you sell at them occasionally and the rest of the time use the van for social activities, a private policy should be fine. But if you're a regular trader, insurers may class this as using the van for business purposes. Either way, it's always a good idea to check with your insurance company.

Why is van insurance so expensive?
If you've got car insurance but are finding the premiums for van insurance quotes are much more expensive, there's a reason for this. It's because the costs associated with van insurance claims tend to be much higher due to factors like the cost of equipment inside the van. Insurers offset this risk by charging higher premiums.

 

If you have a clean driving licence and have built up no claims on previous van policies, these will also help you get quality, cheap van insurance.

Can you use car no claims on van insurance?
Unfortunately, you can only transfer no claims discount built up on van insurance policies. You can't apply the discount to multiple vehicles, either.

Can I get temporary van insurance?
Some insurers offer specific, short-term insurance policies if you're planning to use a van on a short-term basis.

Can I transfer my NCD from my car to my van?
Unfortunately not. If you've built up a no claims discount driving a car, you can only transfer it to another car. No claims discounts can't be applied to multiple vehicles.

I've been involved in an accident. What do I do?
If you need to report an incident or make a claim, call us as soon as possible on 0333 321 9800 . We'll ask you for your policy number so make sure you have it to hand. Lines are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Goods in transit cover
If you transport cargo in your van, then you'll need goods in transit. This cover protects you against loss or damage of the goods whilst driving them from one place to another. If you regularly transport high-value items or hazardous products, you'll need to give details of them at the time of getting a quote.

Courier/haulage insurance (carriage of goods for hire or reward)
If you're a delivery driver who uses your van to transport other people's goods for payment, courier/haulage insurance is for you.

Courier insurance is more suitable if you make multiple drop-offs each day at numerous addresses. Haulage insurance, on the other hand, is required when you carry out one or two drop-offs each day, usually through regular contracts. Both courier and haulage policies feature cover for goods in transit.

Carriage of own goods
This cover is for self-employed traders - such as plumbers, electricians and builders - who transport personal tools and equipment in their vans for their job. The policy protects you, the van and your own belongings in the event of an accident, theft or damage. Under the policy, the van will also be covered for social, domestic and pleasure use.

If you're still unsure about the type of cover you need, get in contact with your insurer. You don't want to risk taking out the wrong policy, which could see an insurer refusing a claim.

Van insurance with Hastings Direct
If something were to go wrong, we'll do everything we can to help you get back to business as quick as possible.

You can tailor your policy by choosing from a range of optional extras, including:

Breakdown cover
Roadside assistance and misfuelling are covered under our basic breakdown cover, but you can upgrade to enjoy features such as recovery away from home, emergency driver and home service.

Personal accident
Van personal accident cover will provide you with financial help if you suffer certain injuries as a result of an accident in the insured van. Those injuries include loss of a limb, hearing, speech, or sight in one or both eyes.

Hire van cover
If your van is stolen or damaged beyond repair, we'll arrange for a courtesy van for up to 28 days. Under hire van cover, we'll deliver the van to you free of charge and within one working day of you reporting the incident to us.
