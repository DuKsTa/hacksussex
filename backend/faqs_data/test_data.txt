How do I get proof of my no claims discount?
"

Answer:
"
You'll find your no claims discount (NCD) in the app or online in MyAccount, where you can view, download and print it at any time.

Simply log in, go to the Documents section and select Get NCD. A letter with all your NCD information will be uploaded to the app or MyAccount and we'll email you when it's ready to view, normally within two hours.

Otherwise:

If your policy's ended or been cancelled, your NCD will be listed in the last letter we sent you, called Your insurance ends today.
If you've made a claim - or are in the middle of making one, you may not see the Get NCD option.
Don't forget, you can only use your NCD on one insurance policy at a time

Question:
"
What's accidental damage cover?
"

Answer:
"
Accidental damage covers you for damage caused by one off accidents to either your property or its contents. 

If your policy number starts with 'H', you're automatically covered for damage to:

Contents - Home entertainment equipment, mirrors and glass.

You can upgrade to our additional level which also covers you for things like spillages on your carpet or sofa.

Buildings - Fixed glass, sanitary ware, pipes and cables.

You can upgrade to our additional level which also covers you for things like putting your foot through a ceiling or leaving a tap running.  

You can see if you’re covered in your documents under ‘Statement of insurance’. 

If your policy number starts with 'XA', you don't have accidental damage cover included as standard, but can add it to your policy any time to cover you for all of the above.
You can see if you’re covered in your documents under ‘Policy summary’.

Question:
"
What happens if the accident is my fault?
"
Answer:
"
If you have a comprehensive policy and you're involved in an accident, we'll make it our priority to get you back on the road as quickly as possible. We'll either arrange for your vehicle to be repaired or make a payment for your vehicle if it's a total loss (or 'write off'). If the accident involved someone else, we'll contact them and offer to repair their vehicle or pay for a replacement if it's a total loss. This allows us to settle the claim as quickly as possible and control the costs involved too. If there's any disagreement about who was at fault, we'll review all the evidence available. We can then determine who was responsible - and if we can recover all or some of our costs. We'll let you know the outcome and if your policy has been impacted. 

If you have a third-party fire and theft policy or third party only, your policy doesn't include cover for accidental damage to your own vehicle, so you can't make a claim for the costs of fixing or replacing it. If there are any claims made against you, we will deal with them.
